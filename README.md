### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application allows users to select a message option and receive a random piece of mantra or affirmation. User can also favorite the messages they like for future reference. This applications makes it easy for the users to create their own favorite message collections and empower people with meaningful words. 

### Installation Instructions:

1. Copy repository `SSH link`.
2. Run `git clone` followed by the `SSH link` in your `terminal`.
3. Move into the `self-care-center` directory using the `cd` command in your `terminal`.
4. Once in the `self-care-center` directory, run `open index.html` and our app will appear in your browser!

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
Users can choose a message type, either "mantra" or "affirmation", and generate a random message by clicking the "Receive Message" button.

Users can click the "favorite" button to favorite a message and see their favorite messages by clicking the "view favorite" button. When favorite messages are displayed, users can use the "return home" button to return to the home page. The application will keep record of users' favorite messages. Even when the webpage is refreshed, previous favorite messages will still be stored.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I created this application while in the midst of the beginning stages of the Turing Front End program. While only three weeks into mod 1 and with the given knowledge and resources, this application took me about four days to complete, involving a significant amount of self-teaching and experiments.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize the programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins: 
- I was able to teach myself new concepts that I hadn't learned from class. 
- I was able to independently complete this project, find bugs on my own, and solve the problems. 
- I was able to create an application that matches a provided comp.


Challenges: 
- This is my very first time of writing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. It was kind of intimidating at first. I got over the challenge by taking one small step at a time. I created the general structure for the webpage first. Then I broke the goal down into several small questions and solved them one by one. 
- I was unfamiliar with flexbox. I played "flex froggy" to do more practice, it helped me become more comfortable with using flexbox.
- I wasn't sure how to add event listeners on multiple buttons within the same `div`. I did online reserach and test them out to find the correct solution.
